# Contact Management System

This is a simple and interactive Contact Management System built using Python and Tkinter. Developed during my software development internship at Prodigy Infotech, this application allows users to store, view, edit, and delete contacts with their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The system saves contact data in a persistent contacts.json file, ensuring that the data remains available across sessions. The clean and intuitive GUI is created with Tkinter.
